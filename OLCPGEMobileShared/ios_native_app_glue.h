 *   IOS Native GLUE
 *   This header file allows for the ios Objecive C code to commuciate with the C/C++ PGE Mobile Code
 *   What is a GLUE Adapther: See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code
 *   In computer programming, glue code is executable code (often source code) that serves solely to "adapt" different parts
 *   of code that would otherwise be incompatible.
 *   Glue code does not contribute any functionality towards meeting program requirements.
